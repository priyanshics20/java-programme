/* Q. The Olympic results are given in a table, where each row represents a country, and columns represent gold, silver,
and bronze medals. For example, the element r[0][0] is the number of gold medals earned by the 0-th country.
Write a method that takes the table as an input, and returns a new array which lists the total number of medals for each country.
For example, if we start with the table
     2   0   1
     3   2   0
     0   0   2
in which the 0-th country earned 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 medals, the 1-st country earned 3 + 2 + 0 = 5 medals, and the 2nd country earned
0 + 0 + 2 = 2 medals, your method should return an array with values
   3
   5
   2     */
